# Chia Faucet
This code is used to run on chia.crypto-faucet.ml

In total, my faucet makes more than 800 000 transaction, little bit later i'll publish second part - payment gateway that makes payments from chia wallet to users.

To run this project you need:
- vps 1 cpu 1gb ram 10 gb hdd
- webserver - nginx
- database - postgresql
- queue - rabbitmq

BTW:
This is my first flask project, so, don't be harsh.
